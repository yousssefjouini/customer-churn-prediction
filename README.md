# Customer Churn Prediction (BCG Gamma)


This project's aim is to predict customer churn using transactional data, during a hackathon with BCG Gamma(2023). It uses XGBoost classifier and  Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) technique to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not.

## Results

- 76% of churning customers identified (Recall)
- 55% of predicted churning found to have churned (Precision)
- 88% of non-churning customers identified
